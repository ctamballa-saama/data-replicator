# DataReplicator - Intelligent Clinical Data Replication Tool

## Overview
DataReplicator is a tool designed to learn patterns from existing clinical trial datasets and generate new, synthetic data that maintains the same statistical properties, relationships, and domain-specific integrity. Rather than parsing protocol documents, this tool focuses on analyzing existing data samples to understand their structure and generate additional realistic data points.

## Problem Statement
When developing and testing clinical data management systems, a common challenge is the lack of sufficient sample data. Often, developers have access to only a limited number of subject records (e.g., 20 subjects) but need more extensive datasets to properly test their systems at scale. Manually creating additional test data is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency.

## Solution: DataReplicator
DataReplicator will analyze existing clinical trial datasets across multiple domains (e.g., Demographics, Adverse Events, Lab Tests) and generate new subject data that maintains the same characteristics, relationships, and constraints as the original data.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Pattern Recognition
- Analyze the structure, format, and content of existing clinical datasets
- Identify domain-specific patterns (e.g., typical ranges for lab values, common adverse event profiles)
- Detect relationships between data domains (e.g., correlation between patient demographics and lab results)
- Learn time-based patterns in longitudinal data

### 2. Statistical Modeling
- Extract statistical distributions of numeric values
- Map categorical value frequencies and conditional probabilities
- Model time-series patterns for events and measurements
- Preserve cross-domain correlations and dependencies

### 3. Intelligent Data Generation
- Generate new subject records that adhere to learned patterns
- Maintain internal consistency across all data domains
- Preserve domain-specific logic and clinical plausibility
- Support variable-scale generation (from tens to thousands of subjects)

### 4. Data Integrity Preservation
- Maintain CDISC SDTM compliance in generated data
- Preserve referential integrity across related domains
- Ensure generated data passes the same validation checks as original data
- Maintain the same data quality characteristics as the source

### 5. Configuration and Controls
- Specify exact number of new subjects to generate
- Adjust statistical parameters to control data variation
- Define constraints for specific variables or relationships
- Support for handling rare events and edge cases

### 6. Caching
- Cache generated data models to speed up future generation requests
- Store analysis results for quick retrieval and comparison
- Cache intermediate processing steps to optimize performance
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation based on source data changes

### 7. Data Model Emulation
- Emulate various data standards and formats (SDTM, ADaM, OMOP, etc.)
- Support for different clinical data structures across therapeutic areas
- Configurable emulation settings for different clinical data systems
- Version control for different data standard implementations

### 8. Failure Simulation
- Simulate data quality issues to test system robustness
- Introduce controlled anomalies and outliers in generated data
- Simulate missing data patterns according to configurable profiles
- Generate edge cases for stress-testing data management systems

### 9. Rate Limiting
- Control the speed and volume of data generation
- Implement usage quotas for different user tiers
- Configure batch processing limits for resource management
- Prioritize critical generation requests over routine ones

### 10. Authentication
- Secure user authentication for accessing the system
- Role-based access control for different data generation capabilities
- API key management for programmatic access
- Integration with enterprise authentication systems

## User Interface

The user journey looks something like this:

- User logs in with their email and password or via social login (Google, GitHub, etc).
- User can create a new data generation project, specifying a name, description, and target data domains.
- Users upload sample datasets in various formats (CSV, SAS, etc.) that contain existing clinical data.
- The system analyzes the uploaded data and provides a summary of detected patterns and relationships.
- Users can configure data generation parameters including:
  - Number of subjects to generate
  - Statistical variation parameters
  - Domain-specific constraints
  - Anomaly injection settings
- The system generates the synthetic data based on the learned patterns.
- Users can preview the generated data, run validation checks, and make adjustments as needed.
- The final datasets can be downloaded in various formats or pushed directly to target systems via API.

## Implementation

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Frontend: React + Tailwind UI
- Database: SQLite
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Version Control: Git
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker

### Architecture
- Modular design with separate services for data analysis, model building, and data generation
- RESTful API for all operations
- WebSocket support for real-time progress updates during lengthy operations
- Background task processing for computationally intensive operations
- Horizontal scaling capability for handling large dataset generation

## DataReplicator Settings

- Allow/disallow new user registration
- Allow/disallow login via social login (Google, GitHub, etc)
- Allow/disallow login via email and password
- Global data generation limits and quotas
- Default output formats and standards
- System-wide caching policies

## Logging

- All data generation requests should be logged
- All model training and analysis operations should be logged
- All errors and validation issues should be logged
- Logs should indicate:
  - Cache hits/misses
  - Rate limit hits/misses
  - Processing time for each operation
  - Resource utilization metrics
  - Data generation costs (computation time)

## Authentication

- Use FastAPI-Users for authentication
- An environment variable should control whether DataReplicator allows new user registration
  - If not allowed, only specific email addresses or domains can register (default behavior)
- Login should support:
  - Email + password
  - Social login (Google, GitHub, etc)

## Benefits
- Rapid generation of realistic test data at any scale
- Consistent data quality across original and synthetic records
- Preservation of complex relationships between clinical data domains
- Time and cost savings compared to manual test data creation
- Improved testing coverage for data management systems
- Customizable data quality profiles for robust system testing

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional clinical data formats and standards
- Integration with data visualization tools
- Advanced anomaly injection for testing data validation systems
- Direct API integration with clinical data management platforms
- Machine learning model export and import capabilities
- Collaborative workspaces for team-based data generation projects
