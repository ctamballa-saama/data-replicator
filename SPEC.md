# DataReplicator MVP Specification

## Core Objective
Develop a minimal viable product that can analyze existing clinical datasets (for approximately 20 subjects) and generate additional synthetic subject data (to reach approximately 100 subjects total) while maintaining statistical properties, relationships, and domain-specific integrity.

## MVP Features

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Support for CSV file format input
- Ability to upload multiple domain files (e.g., demographics, lab results, etc.)
- Basic file validation to ensure proper formatting

### 2. Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis of existing data patterns across domains
- Identification of value distributions, frequencies, and ranges
- Detection of relationships between domains and dependent variables
- Analysis of temporal sequences where applicable

### 3. Data Generation
- User-configurable subject count (to expand from 20 to desired number, e.g., 100)
- Generation of synthetic data maintaining statistical properties of original data
- Preservation of cross-domain relationships and data integrity
- Complete randomization of PII fields while maintaining relationships with other data

### 4. Validation
- Built-in CDISC validation rules
- Support for custom validation rules via user input
- Validation reporting for generated data

### 5. Data Export
- Export of generated data as CSV files
- Organization by domains matching input structure

### 6. User Interface
- Simple login and authentication system
- Admin role for system configuration and user management
- Regular user role for data generation tasks
- Viewer role for visualization access
- Basic UI for file upload, configuration, and download
- Minimal visualization showing data completeness metrics

### 7. Error Handling
- Basic error reporting for data ingestion issues
- Validation error reporting for generated data

## Technical Implementation

### Deployment Model
- On-premises application initially
- Containerized solution to support future cloud deployment

### System Requirements
- 16 GB RAM minimum
- 6-core processor minimum
- Sufficient disk space for data storage (recommend minimum 50GB)

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Frontend: React + Tailwind UI
- Database: SQLite
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core data ingestion, analysis, and generation capability
2. **Phase 2**: User interface and authentication
3. **Phase 3**: Validation rules and error reporting
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and optimization

## User Roles
- **Admin Users**: Configure system settings and manage users
- **Regular Users**: Create and run data generation projects
- **Viewers**: Access to view generated data and basic visualizations

## Data Privacy
- Complete randomization of PII-like fields
- Maintenance of relationships between randomized data and other domains

## Performance Goals
- Optimized for smaller datasets (20-100 subjects)
- Quick analysis and generation (minutes rather than hours)
- Responsive UI during data processing operations

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Advanced statistical modeling for complex relationships
- Additional input/output formats beyond CSV
- Integration with Veeva system for direct data push
- Anomaly injection capabilities (missing data, out-of-range values, inconsistent relationships)
- Advanced visualization and reporting tools
- Caching for improved performance
- Rate limiting and advanced authentication
- Support for larger datasets and more complex statistical models
